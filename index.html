        <strong>Welcome</strong> This website is a pictorial record of how
        Biggin Hill has changed over the last 100 years using old and new
        photographs.

          <div class="landing-para">
            In the early 1900's, William Nelson, a local professional
            photographer, took a series of photographs of Biggin Hill and
            surrounding area. They show a very different scene from that of
            today. I have revisited the locations and tried to capture exactly
            the same images (traffic on Main Road permitting!) as they appear
            today. Many of the old buildings still exist but, as you'll see, the
            surroundings are very different. I would like to thank John Nelson
            for the use of his grandfather's photographs and for using some of
            his text from his book 'Grandfathers Biggin Hill'. Since creating
            this site in 2000 I have acquired numerous photographs from a
            variety of sources. Many have come as a result of this site so if
            you have any old photographs of Biggin Hill, and surrounding area,
            that you feel could be used on this site (no matter how
            insignificant you may think they are) then please Email me
